Works with the Ubuntu GNU Radio Live DVD (OS), GNU Radio Companion (software) and HackRF One (hardware)
Done following the 1st video of tutorials : http://greatscottgadgets.com/sdr/1

This is a simple FM radio receiver. 
You can change channel with a 100MHz granularity and gain (multiply the signal by 0.1*N) from 0 to 10.

More SDR related projects to come soon...
